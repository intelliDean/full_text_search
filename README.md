# Full Text Search
This project showcases how to implement full text search in a PostgreSQL database using PostgreSQL functions such as setweight, to_tsvector, and trigger. To use these functions effectively, the database migration tool Flyway is used to write the SQL queries and PostgreSQL functions to the database on the server.
This project is a good example of how to share knowledge and make it public for others to use and learn from, even if the original code cannot be shared.
